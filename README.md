# PyCitySchools Pandas Challenge

&nbsp; The included code was developed exclusively using the starter code provided and knowledge obtained during class. No TAs, instructors, or other students were consulted for help in developing the code. I did confirm my data frame results with Matthew Ray's work, to ensure that all of my calculations went smoothly, and that my results matched someone else's. 

&nbsp; An explanation of the analysis completed and carried out, as well as my analysis of the observable trends, is included in the markdown cell at the top of the main jupyter notebook [document](https://github.com/laxleary/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/main.ipynb).
